# 📘 BM Hints – Information Broker System

A polished, configurable information‑broker system for FiveM.  
Players can approach NPCs, purchase information, and receive hints through multiple delivery methods such as email, text, map markers, items, and more.

Designed with modularity, UX, and server‑owner flexibility in mind.

---

## ✨ Features

- Unlimited NPC information brokers  
- Custom hint categories per NPC  
- Multiple payment types  
  - Cash  
  - Bank  
  - Item  
- Per‑hint cooldown system  
- Six delivery methods  
  - Email  
  - Item  
  - Waypoint  
  - Blip  
  - Notify (with custom duration)  
- Optional ped blips + markers  
- Fully configurable  
- Modular client/server structure  
- Optimized (0.02ms idle)

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- **QBCore (qbx_core)**
- **ox_lib**
- **ox_target**
- **qb-phone** (or any phone using qb-phone email export)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Player approaches an NPC (ped).  
2. Interacts using **ox_target**.  
3. A menu opens showing available hints.  
4. Player selects a hint → payment is processed.  
5. Server checks:  
   - Payment  
   - Cooldown  
6. If approved → hint is delivered using the configured method.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Drag the `bm-hints` folder into your server’s resources.
2. Add to your `server.cfg`:
```
ensure bm-hints
```

3. Configure your NPCs and hints inside `config.lua`.
